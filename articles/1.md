#Why I built this platform
Knowledge is one of the most valuable commodities we possess. It is through shared knowledge that we advance, grow, and inspire others to reach new heights. This belief in the power of knowledge sharing and its potential to inspire and educate others was the driving force behind my decision to create an interview platform aimed at encouraging people to contribute and share their questions.
