# Why InterviewDose ?
Knowledge is one of the most valuable commodities we possess. It is through shared knowledge that we advance, grow, and inspire others to reach new heights. This belief in the power of knowledge sharing and its potential to inspire and educate others was the driving force behind my decision to create an interview platform aimed at encouraging people to contribute and share their questions.

Approximately three years ago, I initiated this project. I reached out to many of you for assistance but eventually decided to pursue it as my personal leisure-time project. I began with the YouTube journey to create some contents and later developed this website so that others like me, who wish to share their tips and techniques to assist their community, can also benefit from this platform.

The issue with YouTube is that, despite being a vast source of knowledge, it often inundates learners with a lot of noise. This is why learners can easily deviate from their intended goals. Moreover, if you're seeking premium content, it can sometimes be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, I wanted to create a closed-ended, freemium platform that effectively filters out the noise, aiming to assist job seekers and career-oriented professionals. And here it is, right in front of you.

# Who is it for?
You might have noticed a few questions on the front page, primarily focused on computer science and catering to coding aspirants. As a software engineer, creating content in this domain was more straightforward for me. However, if you have questions from other fields, please don't hesitate to post and share them here. You can reach out to us via email at interviewdose@gmail.com if you'd like to contribute questions for a specific category, we would greatly appreciate your input. Alternatively, you can also publish questions directly on this platform yourself.

I've had discussions with numerous colleagues about the idea of sharing their content on platforms like YouTube to benefit others, but one of the challenges is that for those who only want to share a few videos, there aren't many suitable options available at the moment. If you find yourself in this situation, rest assured that this platform is here to support you in promoting your efforts, ensuring that your valuable contributions do not go to waste.

Whether you're preparing for a job in a service-based industry or aiming for top-tier tech companies, this platform can help. If you're looking for a quick ramp-up and revision before your interview for *service-based org, the easy questions* in our list can be quite helpful. However, if you're targeting the top tech giants, I recommend exploring the medium to hard questions shared on this site to thoroughly prepare yourself.

I have a passion for writing, where I share my experiences with personal computer science projects or create content for YouTube.
