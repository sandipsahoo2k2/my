## Transparency 
Transparency in AI means algorithms and data. It is important that we understand the algorithm and we have access to and understand the data too. 
There are six challenges of transparency in AI implementations such as 

1. Trade secret ( if AI is a trade secret then company might be reluctant to explain how their solution work)

2. When people are Gaming the system they may not want people have to transparency 

3. User needs to be able to understand what is AI and the AI system should be  able to explain how they work in a way user understand

4. How the AI explains, what medium it will present the data to the user, so here we see some communication challenges

5. There are challenges with data privacy. when the system wants the data to be protected and then the data cant be open to everey one.

6. When different organisations building different parts of the AI based system then it may be hard to understand and explain how the system works.

 ## Impact of transparency in the field of research
 
The biggest reason for transparency in the filed of research is to strengthen a conceptual bridge between the fields of research dealing with ‘algorithmic transparency’ and accountability.
Here we are talking about accountability  if an algorithm is harmful, algorithmic transparency creates trust.
There should be supervisory authorities to develop methods for algorithmic governance for creating harmless and trust worthy AI systems.
