## AWS SNS - filtering, SQS, Fanout

Amazon SNS is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service. With Amazon SNS, you can use topics to simultaneously distribute messages to multiple subscribing endpoints such as Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, HTTP endpoints, email addresses, and mobile devices (SMS, Push).

Amazon SQS is a message queue service used by distributed applications to exchange messages through a polling model. It can be used to decouple sending and receiving components without requiring each component to be concurrently available.

A fanout scenario occurs when a message published to an SNS topic is replicated and pushed to multiple endpoints, such as Amazon SQS queues, HTTP(S) endpoints, and Lambda functions. This allows for parallel asynchronous processing.

For example, you can develop an application that publishes a message to an SNS topic whenever an order is placed for a product. Then, two or more SQS queues that are subscribed to the SNS topic receive identical notifications for the new order. An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) server instance attached to one of the SQS queues can handle the processing or fulfillment of the order. And you can attach another Amazon EC2 server instance to a data warehouse for analysis of all orders received.

By default, an Amazon SNS topic subscriber receives every message published to the topic. You can use Amazon SNS message filtering to assign a filter policy to the topic subscription, and the subscriber will only receive a message that they are interested in. Using Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS together, messages can be delivered to applications that require immediate notification of an event. This method is known as fanout to Amazon SQS queues.
