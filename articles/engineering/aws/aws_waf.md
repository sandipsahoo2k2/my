## AWS Web Application Firewall ( WAF )

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to create security rules that block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, and rules that filter out specific traffic patterns you define. You can deploy AWS WAF on Amazon CloudFront as part of your CDN solution, the Application Load Balancer that fronts your web servers or origin servers running on EC2, or Amazon API Gateway for your APIs.
To detect and mitigate DDoS attacks, you can use AWS WAF in addition to AWS Shield. AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps detect and mitigate web application layer DDoS attacks by inspecting traffic inline. Application layer DDoS attacks use well-formed but malicious requests to evade mitigation and consume application resources. You can define custom security rules that contain a set of conditions, rules, and actions to block attacking traffic. After you define web ACLs, you can apply them to CloudFront distributions, and web ACLs are evaluated in the priority order you specified when you configured them.

By using AWS WAF, you can configure web access control lists (Web ACLs) on your CloudFront distributions or Application Load Balancers to filter and block requests based on request signatures. Each Web ACL consists of rules that you can configure to string match or regex match one or more request attributes, such as the URI, query-string, HTTP method, or header key. In addition, by using AWS WAF’s rate-based rules, you can automatically block the IP addresses of bad actors when requests matching a rule exceed a threshold that you define. Requests from offending client IP addresses will receive 403 Forbidden error responses and will remain blocked until request rates drop below the threshold. This is useful for mitigating HTTP flood attacks that are disguised as regular web traffic.
It is recommended that you add web ACLs with rate-based rules as part of your AWS Shield Advanced protection. These rules can alert you to sudden spikes in traffic that might indicate a potential DDoS event. A rate-based rule counts the requests that arrive from any individual address in any five-minute period. If the number of requests exceeds the limit that you define, the rule can trigger an action such as sending you a notification.

## AWS Shield
Even though AWS WAF can help you block common attack patterns to your VPC such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, this is still not enough to **withstand DDoS attacks**. For higher levels of protection against attacks targeting your applications running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Load Balancing(ELB), Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon Route 53 resources, you can subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced. In addition to the network and transport layer protections that come with Standard, AWS Shield Advanced provides additional detection and mitigation against large and sophisticated DDoS attacks, near real-time visibility into attacks, and integration with AWS WAF, a web application firewall.
AWS Shield Advanced also gives you 24×7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT) and protection against DDoS related spikes in your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Load Balancing(ELB), Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon Route 53 charges.
