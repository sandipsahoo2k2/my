* A **Binary Tree** is made of nodes, where each node contains a left pointer, a right pointer, and a data element.
It is either empty (represented by a null pointer), or is made of a single node of which
the left and right pointers each point to a binary tree.

* A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** or ordered binary tree is a type of binary tree where the _nodes are arranged
in order_: for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less-or-equal to the node (<=), 
and all the elements in its right subtree are greater than the node (>).

* A **Max Heap** is a tree in which each node's children have values less than or equal to node's value.
Consequently, the root node always has the largest value in the tree, which means that it's possible to find
the maximum value in constant time: Simply return the root value.
  Like wise there is **Min Heap** whose node's children values greater than its node's value.
So, if extraction the min value needs to be fast, we should use a min heap.
