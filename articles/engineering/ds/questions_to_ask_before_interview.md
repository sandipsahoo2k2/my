## Ask these questions to your interviewer before you solve the problem

### 1. Arrays
Usually online data structures interview questions are mostly around **arrays**. So ask few of these questions before you start solving it.  

- What's the max size of the array ? ( recursion is allowed or not ? )
- Does it contain null values ( if string array or objects array )
- Is it 0-indexed ?
- Does it contain negative numbers ?
- Does it contain zero values ?
- Can it contain float values or mixed types ? ( possible if it's a scripting language )
