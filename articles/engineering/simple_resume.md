### Visit John Doe's Homepage (ft. Single-Page Resume)

In today’s fast-paced world **single-page applications** are on high demand isn't it ? I visited the popular John Doe's homepage, I started thinking — Why should a portfolio / resume be any different ? **A clean, concise single-page brand is the modern way to stand out online**. So, this week, I created this simple and innovative platform that lets you effortlessly showcase your portfolio, resume, or articles—without any need for hosting or technical setup. _I believe every linkedIn professional must have a "Visit my link" like this cover._  

I bet you’ve come across countless single-page portfolios. It’s become a trend to add website links to LinkedIn, Facebook, or Instagram profiles. Many people proudly share links like "Visit my website", "Visit my blog" or "Read my article" to showcase their personal pages, blogs, or websites. **Have you ever thought about having one for yourself?** Don’t worry if you don’t have one yet—I’ve got something exciting for you today. _I believe every student or professional should have a LinkedIn link that says "View my resume" or "Visit my portfolio."._

Everyone is unique, and we all have something special to share with the world. So let’s share our personal brand with pride.

You will be surprised how quickly it can be done. **Let's take a peak at John Doe's public homepage**, we just have to copy what he did. You might argue how is it better than others paid and head aching platforms, try it yourself. No tools, no money, and it’s done in no time :) Ok enough talking "let'do it" ->
