### Visit John Doe's Homepage (ft. Single-Page Resume)

In today’s fast-paced world single-page applications are on high demand isn't it ? That's why angular, react or Vue as a skills are in high demand too — Why should your resume be any different ? A clean, concise single-page resume is the modern way to stand out online. 

I bet you might have seen thousands of single page portfolios too. This has become a trend to add a website link to linkedin/facebook/instagram now a days. You might have seen many who you follow take the pride in showing their "Visit my website", "Visit my blog", "Read my article" links to their personal page, blog or sites etc right? Have you thought of having one for your self ?  Don't worry if you don't have. I have something exciting for you today.

I think we all have something special to share with the world around us. I thought why not I build a simple app which would help people share resume or portfolio or may be a poem without even worrying about building/hosting a site.

You will be surprised how fast John Doe built this resume and published, we just have to copy what he did following few steps when you are ready.

- Visit https://publichome.page/simpleresume, to see John Doe's clean and concise resume. 

- Scroll down you will see a github icon, which opens a new tab with text, select all, right click and copy, which copies the text to clipboard.

- Now go to  your own github account ( if not create one it's simple) 

- Create a new public repository called "my" with a readme file.

- Make sure You update your Name and URL for your github profile.

- Edit the readme file and paste the content what you copied from the above github link.

- Update Name, Email, Skills, Experience, Education etc and commit !

That's it you are done with creating your simple yet powerful page to showcase your skills anywhere you want !! 

You can now go to your linked In -> edit your Intro, scroll down in the dialog and update your website with the link https://publichome.page/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME and a link text as shown below.


Lastly you can press Ctrl + P on the page and can print the pdf version of the resume too.

Again you can build anything you want, not necessarily a resume or portfolio and share. It's all about writing texts in that file, no need to know any complex language syntax or use any tool or host. This framework is ultra fast, lean and can fit very well for students, engineers, authors, social celebrities, traders you name it and it will fit your need.
