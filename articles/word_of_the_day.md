# My word of the day

**Delighted** : I was delighted to see so many halloween costumes at today's launch.

**Quixotic** : Isn't it quixotic that it's my first day in office and I broke the build !

**Meraki** : When designing a new website or a MVP, I put a lot of 'meraki' into the details, 
ensuring every element reflected my passion and creativity, making it feel truly unique and personal.  
- **Meaning** : Putting a part of yourself into something, often with passion and care
