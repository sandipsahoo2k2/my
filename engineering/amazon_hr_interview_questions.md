# Star answer format
Amazon bahavioral rounds are focused around their leadership principles. The STAR method is a structured manner of responding to a behavioral-based interview question. Here’s what it looks like:

 
### 1. SITUATION

Describe the situation you were in, or the task you needed to do. Give enough detail for the interviewer to understand the complexities of the situation. This example can be from a previous job, school project, volunteer activity, or other relevant event.

 
### 2. TASK

Describe your goal.

 
### 3. ACTION

Describe the actions you took. Use an appropriate amount of detail. What steps did you take? What was your contribution? Let us know what you did, not what your team or group did. Use the word ‘I,’ not ‘we.’

 
### 4. RESULT

Describe the outcome of your actions. Don’t be shy about taking credit for what you did. What happened? How did it end? What did you accomplish? What did you learn? Provide examples using metrics or data if applicable.

 
Consider your successes and failures in relation to the Leadership Principles. Use examples that showcase your expertise and how you’ve taken risks, succeeded, failed, and grown. Keep in mind that some of our most successful programs have risen from the ashes of failed projects. Failure is a necessary part of innovation. We believe in failing early and persevering until we get it right.


# Amazon Leadership principles
We use our Leadership Principles every day. They are crucial to discussing ideas for new projects and to deciding the best ways to solve problems. They're just one of the things that makes us peculiar. All candidates are evaluated based on these principles. The best way to prepare for your interview is to consider how you’ve applied them in your past. Below are the 16 Leadership principles that are focued in the behavioral rounds.

 
### 1. Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

 
### 2. Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."

 
### 3. Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

 
### 4. Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

 
### 5. Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

 
### 6. Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

 
### 7. Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

 
### 8. Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

 
### 9. Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

 
### 10. Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

 
### 11. Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

 
### 12. Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

 
### 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.


### 14. Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

 
### 15. Strive to be Earth's Best Employer
Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.

 
### 16. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility
Amazon started in a garage, but it's not there anymore. This is what Amazon's word to their employees ...
We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.

# Behavioral questions

Amazon asks about past situations or challenges you’ve faced, using our principles to guide our discussion.

Here are examples of questions:

- Tell me about a time when you were faced with a problem that had a number of possible solutions. What was the problem and how did you decide what to do? What was the outcome?
- When did you take a risk, make a mistake, or fail? How did you respond? How did you grow from it?
- Describe a time you took the lead on a project.
- What did you do when you needed to motivate a group or promote collaboration on a project?
- How have you used data to develop a strategy?
  
Ensure your answers are well-structured. Provide examples using metrics or data if applicable. Reference recent situations when possible.

# Tips for greate answers

- Practice using the STAR method. Frame your examples in relation to the Leadership Principles.

- Ensure each answer has a beginning, middle, and end. Describe the situation or problem, the actions you took, and the outcome.

- Prepare short descriptions of a handful of situations. Be ready to answer follow-up questions in greater detail. Select examples that highlight your unique skills.

- Have examples that showcase your experience and how you’ve taken risks, succeeded, failed, and grown.

- Specifics are key. Avoid generalizations. Give a detailed account of one situation for each question you answer. Use data or metrics to support your example.

- Be forthcoming. Don't embellish or omit parts of the story.
