## Meet IA+ - Your interview assistant
I woke up little early on day before thanks giving. I was just browsing the internet as usual lying on the bed before being super active. I stumbled upon a youtube video where the founder of Perplexity was talking about how they built an ai platform and how is it different from others. The product is a blend of Chat GPT with mixture of posts and videos on similar topics.

I thought, why not try to build something similar in interviewdose.com for interview aspirants. I remembered, I did try out something with openai an year back to test it’s api capabilities. I didn’t find that poc anymore. Doesn’t matter I could quickly wrote a simple poc in few minutes to test if I get what I want from openai and yes.

I got excited about the long weekend and thanks giving holidays. Wow what a nice coincidence. I get time to build something which will be helpful for the interview aspirants and show case my new MVP idea and a freaking passionate technologist :). I finished my day job went to Dunkin for a coffee. I like the Dunkin’s Coffee Cups design more than their coffee. They are unique try comparing how and you might like them too. I will write about them in a separate blog may be :)

_I was totally excited about the night-out like a hackathon night. I really get too excited when there is a long weekend as almost always I have build a new product in a long weekend._

So I came up with this small goal this long weekend I will build and integrate an interview assistant [ IA ]. It’s not a typo yes.

I started building the UI exactly like Chat GPT as a senior backend engineer. Coded in future tense, used Angular and bootstrap as always for my UI development. I took my next almost 40 hours building only UI . Yes UI is tuff for a backend engineer like me.

I had this 4 goals in mind

- should have intelligence — dough
- should look like Chat GPT — beautiful
- should have Generative AI like loading bars
- And a video scrollers for the youtube videos — the scroll effect had to be exactly like how the youtube sells girl shows the store products ( sorry I don’t know her name)

Trust me, the most amount of time it took me was for building the youtube video scroller but I am still not 100% satisfied with it. I had to give a full stop at a point — as I was coding for almost 40 hours non stop breaking the eat-code-sleep cycle. Guess what I used a circular queue for the scroller [ So yeah interview questions are around some of your future work note that they are not random like how you might hear from lots of youtubers ]

Let’s not talk too much as a strict believer of Doer :) Here is how it looks and watch this short video in action and do visit interviewdose.com to try this intelligent [IA+](https://interviewdose.com/ia) at work.
