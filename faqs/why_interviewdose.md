## Why InterviewDose ?
Knowledge is one of the most valuable commodities we possess. It is through shared knowledge that we advance, grow, and inspire others to reach new heights. This belief in the power of knowledge sharing and its potential to inspire and educate others was the driving force behind my decision to create an interview platform aimed at encouraging people to contribute and share their questions.

I began with the YouTube journey to create some contents for the site to start with. Given my background as a software engineer, crafting content in this domain came naturally to me. after successfully completing another significant personal project, I finally began working on this website as a leisure-time project. This platform now serves as a means for people like me, who wish to share their questions, tips and techniques to benefit them and their community for interview preparation.

The issue with YouTube is that, despite being a vast source of knowledge, it often inundates learners with a lot of noise. This is why learners can easily deviate from their intended goals. Moreover, if you're seeking premium content, it can sometimes be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, I created a open-ended, freemium platform that effectively filters out the noise, aiming to assist job seekers and career-oriented professionals. And here it is, right in front of you. I will be adding many features in coming days, encourage people by sharing this site so that more and more content can be added by others and freely available to all of us.

## Who is it for?
You might have noticed a few questions on the front page, primarily focused on computer science and catering to coding aspirants. As a software engineer, creating content in this domain was more straightforward for me. However, if you'd like to contribute questions for a different category, This platform allowes writers, creators to publish their work directly like linkedIn or Medium. Watch the [Howto Video](https://youtu.be/9m_Q54aply0) to publish your content or *You can also reach out to me via email at interviewdose@gmail.com*, I would greatly appreciate your input. Alternatively, you can also share questions in the discord server.

I've had discussions with numerous colleagues about the idea of sharing their content on platforms like YouTube to benefit others, but one of the challenges is that for those who only want to share a few videos, there aren't many suitable options available at the moment. If you find yourself in this situation, rest assured that this platform is here to support you in promoting your efforts, ensuring that your valuable contributions do not go to waste.

Whether you're preparing for a job in a service-based industry or aiming for top-tier tech companies or want to help your students this platform can help. If you're looking for a quick ramp-up and revision before your interview I recommend exploring these questions in the list shared on this site to thoroughly prepare yourself.

You will see me adding more and more articles going forward.
